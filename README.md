# BrowserLocation

Use the native navigator.geolocation to get your current Location.
I kept wondering why all the GeoLocation widgets in the AppStore were PhoneGap widgets, and when the need arose to have the same functionality for a desktop user, I figured I'd quickly create a widget for it!

## Dependencies
Mendix 6.6.0 and up

## Basic Configuration

* Place the widget in a dataview
* Connect the required attributes
* Optionally select a microflow to call when the widget gets a position
